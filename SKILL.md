# Logseq DB Knowledge Base

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive knowledge about Logseq DB (database) graphs, which use a fundamentally different data model from the older file-based (markdown) version of Logseq.

**CRITICAL**: When the user is working with Logseq DB graphs, the traditional file-based Logseq knowledge does NOT apply. Always reference this skill to ensure accuracy.

**Keywords**: logseq database, logseq db, db graphs, nodes, new tags, supertags, classes, tag properties, logseq properties, datalog queries

## Core Concepts

### Nodes - The Foundation

In Logseq DB, **nodes** are the fundamental building block. Both pages and blocks are now called "nodes" because they behave similarly.

**Key Node Behaviors:**
- Nodes are referenced using `[[]]` syntax (same as before)
- All nodes can have properties, tags, and references
- Blocks can be converted to pages by tagging with `#Page`
- Nodes are collapsible with an arrow on the left (appears on hover)
- Nodes can be favorited, embedded, and have linked/unlinked references
- Nodes share the same keybindings for properties and editing

**Pages vs Blocks:**
- **Pages**: Have unique names by tag (e.g., `Apple #Company` and `Apple #Fruit` can coexist)
- **Blocks**: Created within pages; tagged blocks don't require unique names
- **Conversion**: Top-level blocks can become pages by adding `#Page` tag

**Example:**
```
Aug 29th, 2025
  My meeting notes #Page
```
This converts the block "My meeting notes" into a namespaced page under "Aug 29th, 2025"

### New Tags (Classes/Types/Supertags)

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION**: In Logseq DB, "new tags" are NOT the same as file-based tags!

**New tags** (also called classes, types, or supertags) are created with `#NAME` syntax and serve as templates for nodes.

**Creating New Tags:**
```
1. Open Search and type #Person
2. A dialog appears to configure tag properties
3. Add properties like "lastName" and "birthday"
4. Now any node tagged with #Person inherits these properties
```

**Tag Features:**
- Tags can have **parent tags** via the `Extends` property
- Tags inherit properties from all parent tags
- Tags can have their own properties on the tag page
- Tag properties automatically appear on all tagged nodes

**Parent Tag Example:**
```
#Book (has property: author)
  └─ #AudioBook (has property: narrator)
     └─ Inherits: author, narrator

#MediaObject (has property: duration)
  └─ #AudioBook
     └─ Inherits: author, narrator, duration
```

### Properties System

Properties in Logseq DB are powerful and type-safe.

**Property Types:**
1. **Text**: Default type, allows any text, behaves like a block
2. **Number**: Actual numbers (not strings), sorts correctly
3. **Date**: Date picker, links to journal pages, supports repetition
4. **DateTime**: Date + time picker, supports repetition
5. **Checkbox**: Boolean values (checked/unchecked)
6. **Url**: Only allows valid URLs
7. **Node**: Links to other nodes, can be restricted by tag

**Key Property Features:**
- **Default Values**: Properties can have defaults
- **Multiple Values**: Properties can hold multiple values (except checkbox/datetime)
- **Property Choices**: Limit property to specific choices (like enums)
- **UI Position**: Control where property displays (inline, below, beginning, end)
- **Hide by Default**: Hide properties unless zoomed in
- **Tag Properties**: Properties inherited by all nodes with that tag

**Property Shortcuts:**
- `Cmd-p` (or `Ctrl-Alt-p`): Add property to current node
- `Cmd-j`: Quick edit properties
- `p a`: Toggle display all properties
- `p t`: Add/remove tags
- `p i`: Set icon
- `p s`: Set Status (tasks)
- `p p`: Set Priority (tasks)
- `p d`: Set Deadline (tasks)

**Configuring Properties:**
- Click property name for dropdown menu
- `Cmd-click` to navigate to property page
- Configure: type, default value, choices, UI position, multiple values, hide settings

## Tasks in Logseq DB

**CRITICAL**: Tasks work completely differently in Logseq DB!

### Old Way (File-based Logseq) - DOES NOT WORK IN DB:
```
- TODO This is a task
- DOING Working on this
- DONE Completed
```

### New Way (Logseq DB):
```
Tasks are blocks tagged with #Task
Status is a PROPERTY with these values:
- Backlog
- Todo
- Doing
- In Review
- Done
- Canceled
```

**Creating Tasks:**
1. Type `/todo` in a block (adds Status property + #Task tag)
2. Type text and end with `#Task`
3. Add `Deadline` or `Scheduled` property
4. Use `Cmd-Enter` to cycle through Todo → Doing → Done

**Task Properties:**
- **Status**: Property with choices (not a marker!)
- **Priority**: A, B, C priorities
- **Deadline**: Date property
- **Scheduled**: Date property

**Querying Tasks:**

❌ **WRONG (File-based approach):**
```clojure
[:find (pull ?b [*])
 :where [?b :block/marker "DOING"]]
```

✅ **CORRECT (DB approach):**
```clojure
[:find (pull ?b [*])
 :where
 [?b :block/tags ?t]
 [?t :db/ident :logseq.class/Task]
 [?b :logseq.property/status ?s]
 [?s :block/title "Doing"]]
```

**Customizing Tasks:**
1. Customize `Status` property choices on the Status page
2. Add custom properties to `#Task` tag
3. Create custom task types by extending `#Task`:
   - Example: `#ProjectTask` extends `#Task` + adds "project" property

### Repeated Tasks

Repeated tasks work with `Deadline` or `Scheduled` properties:

1. Set Deadline/Scheduled on a task
2. In the popup, check "Repeat task"
3. Configure interval (Day, Week, Month, Year)
4. When Status changes to Done:
   - Status resets to Todo
   - Deadline/Scheduled advances by the interval

## Tag-Based Features

Logseq DB uses new tags to power core features. Each has a built-in table for management.

### Built-in Tags:
- **#Journal**: Daily journal pages
- **#Task**: Task management (see above)
- **#Query**: Simple and advanced queries
- **#Card**: Flashcards using spaced repetition
- **#Asset**: Files (images, PDFs, etc.)
- **#Template**: Reusable block templates
- **#Code**: Code blocks
- **#Quote**: Quote blocks
- **#Math**: LaTeX math blocks
- **#PDF Annotation**: PDF highlights and annotations

**All these tags can be extended** by adding custom properties on their tag pages!

### Journals (#Journal)

- Automatically created for current day
- Reference with natural language: `[[Today]]`, `[[Next Friday]]`, `[[Last Monday]]`
- Use `/Date picker` command for specific dates
- Navigate: `g n` (next day), `g p` (previous day)

### Queries (#Query)

- Create with `/Query` command (query builder)
- Advanced queries: `/Advanced Query` command
- All queries tagged with `#Query`
- View all queries on `#Query` page table

### Cards (#Card)

- Tag blocks with `#Card` to create flashcards
- Uses new spaced repetition algorithm
- Review in "Flashcards" section (left sidebar)
- 4 rating levels for scheduling
- `Due` property shows next review date

### Assets (#Asset)

- Drag and drop files onto blocks
- Batch upload from `#Asset` page
- Stored in graph's `assets/` directory
- Gallery View available for visual assets

### Templates (#Template)

- Create: Tag a block with `#Template`, add children
- Insert: Use `/Template` command
- **Auto-apply**: Use `Apply template to tags` property to auto-insert on tagged nodes
  - Example: Apply template to `#Journal` → appears on every journal page

## Querying Logseq DB

### Common DB Attributes

**IMPORTANT**: These are DB-specific attributes, different from file-based Logseq!

**Node Attributes:**
- `:block/title` - Node title (pages and named blocks)
- `:block/content` - Block text content
- `:block/properties` - Node properties (different structure than file-based)
- `:block/tags` - New tags assigned to node
- `:block/refs` - References to other nodes
- `:block/uuid` - Unique identifier
- `:block/created-at` - Creation timestamp
- `:block/updated-at` - Last update timestamp
- `:db/id` - Database entity ID
- `:db/ident` - Database identifier (e.g., `:logseq.class/Task`)

**Property Attributes:**
- `:logseq.property/status` - Status property
- `:logseq.property/priority` - Priority property
- `:logseq.property/deadline` - Deadline property
- Custom properties: `:logseq.property/YOUR-PROPERTY-NAME`

**Tag Attributes:**
- `:logseq.class/Task` - Task tag
- `:logseq.class/Journal` - Journal tag
- `:logseq.class/Query` - Query tag
- `:logseq.class/Card` - Card tag
- Custom tags: `:logseq.class/YourTagName`

### Query Examples

**CRITICAL: ALL queries in Logseq DB blocks MUST use this exact format:**

**Find all nodes with a specific tag:**
```clojure
{:query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :where
         [?b :block/tags ?t]
         [?t :db/ident :logseq.class/Task]]}
```

**Find tasks with specific status:**
```clojure
{:query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :where
         [?b :block/tags ?t]
         [?t :db/ident :logseq.class/Task]
         [?b :logseq.property/status ?s]
         [?s :block/title "Doing"]]}
```

**Find nodes by property value:**
```clojure
{:query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :where
         [?b :logseq.property/author ?author]
         [?author :block/title "John Doe"]]}
```

**Find all journals:**
```clojure
{:query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :where
         [?b :block/tags ?t]
         [?t :db/ident :logseq.class/Journal]]}
```

**Find nodes by text content:**
```clojure
{:query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :where
         [?b :block/content ?content]
         [(clojure.string/includes? ?content "history")]]}
```

### Query Syntax in Logseq DB

**CRITICAL FORMAT RULE:**

Every advanced query in Logseq DB MUST start with `{:query` and end with `}`.

**Correct format:**
```clojure
{:query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :where
         [?b :block/tags ?t]
         [?t :db/ident :logseq.class/Task]
         [?b :logseq.property/status ?s]
         [?s :block/title "Doing"]]}
```

**Common mistakes - DON'T DO THESE:**
```clojure
; ❌ WRONG - Extra {{query}} wrapper (this is old syntax)
{{query
{:query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :where
         [?b :block/tags ?t]]}
}}

; ❌ WRONG - Missing {:query ...} wrapper entirely
[:find (pull ?b [*])
 :where
 [?b :block/tags ?t]
 [?t :db/ident :logseq.class/Task]]
```

**Example: Find blocks referencing "Alice":**
```clojure
{:query [:find (pull ?b [*])
         :where
         [?person :block/title "Alice"]
         [?b :block/refs ?person]]}
```

### Query Builder (Recommended)

Instead of writing raw queries, use Logseq DB's Query Builder:
1. Type `/Query` command in a block
2. Use the visual interface to build queries
3. Select tag (e.g., #Task)
4. Add property filters (e.g., Status = "Doing")
5. Logseq generates the correct query syntax automatically

See `references/query-examples.md` for more examples.

## Views and Tables

Logseq DB provides powerful table views for managing tagged nodes.

**Table Features:**
- Built-in tables on all tag pages
- Sortable columns (by any property)
- Filterable rows
- Create new nodes directly in table
- Bulk actions on selected rows
- Multiple view types: Table, Gallery (for assets)

**Accessing Tables:**
1. Navigate to any tag page (e.g., `#Task`, `#Journal`)
2. See "Tagged Nodes" section with table
3. Click `+` to create new tagged node
4. Select multiple rows for bulk actions

## Common Misconceptions

When working with Logseq DB, avoid these file-based assumptions:

❌ **WRONG**: Tasks use TODO/DOING/DONE markers
✅ **CORRECT**: Tasks use #Task tag + Status property

❌ **WRONG**: Query tasks with `:block/marker`
✅ **CORRECT**: Query tasks with `:logseq.class/Task` and `:logseq.property/status`

❌ **WRONG**: Tags are just hashtags for organization
✅ **CORRECT**: New tags are classes that define properties and behavior

❌ **WRONG**: Properties are frontmatter in markdown files
✅ **CORRECT**: Properties are structured, typed data in the database

❌ **WRONG**: Pages and blocks are fundamentally different
✅ **CORRECT**: Pages and blocks are both nodes with similar behavior

❌ **WRONG**: Can't have duplicate page names
✅ **CORRECT**: Pages are unique by tag: `Apple #Company` ≠ `Apple #Fruit`

## Best Practices

### 1. Use New Tags for Structure
Create tags for your domain (e.g., `#Person`, `#Project`, `#Meeting`) and define their properties once. All tagged nodes inherit the structure.

### 2. Leverage Property Types
Use the right property type:
- `Number` for quantities (sorts correctly)
- `Date` for dates (links to journals, enables repetition)
- `Node` for relationships (type-safe references)

### 3. Extend Built-in Tags
Add custom properties to `#Task`, `#Journal`, etc. to customize for your workflow.

### 4. Use Templates for Automation
Set templates to auto-apply to tags for consistent structure.

### 5. Query by Tag First
Always start queries by filtering to a tag, then add property filters:
```clojure
[?b :block/tags ?t]
[?t :db/ident :logseq.class/YOUR-TAG]
```

### 6. Use Tables for Bulk Management
Navigate to tag pages and use tables for sorting, filtering, and bulk operations.

## Migration from File-based Logseq

If converting from file-based Logseq:

1. **Tasks**: Use DB Graph Importer in Logseq to convert TODO markers to #Task tags
2. **Tags**: File-based `#tags` become inline tags; evaluate if they should be new tags
3. **Properties**: Markdown frontmatter converts to database properties
4. **Queries**: Rewrite queries using DB attributes (see query examples)

**Important**: Test the importer on a copy of your graph first!
